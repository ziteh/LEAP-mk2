# L.E.A.P upper limb

"Lightweight Exoskeleton with Assistive Power-Upper limb section (L.E.A.P-Upper limb)" is my master's thesis. It's based on the experience of making [L.E.A.P](https://github.com/ziteh/LEAP).  
It is still at an early stage of development.

「輔助性動力輕型外骨骼-上肢部分 (L.E.A.P-上肢, 飛躍)」是我的碩士論文題目。它是以製作 [L.E.A.P](https://github.com/ziteh/LEAP) 的經驗為基礎，製作的上肢動力外骨骼。  
目前還在初期開發階段。
