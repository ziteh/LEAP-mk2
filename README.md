# L.E.A.P Upper Limb

"Lightweight Exoskeleton with Assistive Power, Upper Limb (L.E.A.P-Up)" is my master's thesis. It's an upper limb powered exoskeleton based on the experience of develop [L.E.A.P](https://github.com/ziteh/LEAP).  

It is still at an early stage of development.

「輔助性動力輕型外骨骼-上肢部分 (L.E.A.P-Up)」是我的碩士論文題目。它是以開發 [L.E.A.P](https://github.com/ziteh/LEAP) 的經驗為基礎，製作的上肢動力外骨骼。  

目前還在初期開發階段。
